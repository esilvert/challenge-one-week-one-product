I had One Week to build One Product in association with Laurie Montes, a professional designer at Dernier Cri.

The goal was to design and produce a product that would help youngsters learn their multiplication tables. Ideally, the product would do it like a game does; with rules, winning & losing conditions and some challenge.

Multy3000 fulfills this description by a very arcade design, with infinite prompts that are time limited. The longer you play, the lesser time you've got to answer and the harder are the prompts.

### Messages
Every 10 questions, the difficulty goes up; until 50 questions where the difficulty reaches its peak.

In between rounds, there are motivational messages, such as "Quite a genuis right ? Let's see what you've got"

### Dashboard
The main motivation for a player to replay our game, is to beat the others. When you finish a run, you are assigned a score regarding your performance that places you on a leaderboard. Everyone wants to be in the top 100 right ?
